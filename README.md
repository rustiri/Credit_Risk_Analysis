# Supervised Machine Learning and Credit Risk

## Overview of Project

The goal of this project is to predict credit risk with machine learning algorithms, compare the strengths and weaknesses of machine learning models and to assess how well a model work. 

The following task to complete:
* Use oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms.
* Use undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. 
* Use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. 
* Finally, evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
